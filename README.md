This project used a free API to build a Spring boot app with the following endpoints:
1.    GET the top <number_of_cities> cities in order of population (descending) of Italy, New Zealand and Ghana, where <number_of_cities> is a query parameter passed in the query. 
      And if there are not enough cities, it return the ones available.
2.    An endpoint that takes a country as a parameter (e.g. Italy, Nigeria, …) and returns its population, capital city, location, currency and ISO2&3.
3.    An endpoint that takes a country as a parameter (e.g. Italy, Nigeria, …) and returns the full list of all the states in the country and all the cities in each state.
4.    An endpoint that takes a country as a parameter (e.g. Italy, Nigeria, …), a monetary amount and a target currency and provides the country currency and converts the amount to the target currency and formats it correctly
5.    using the currency conversion csv file provided.
